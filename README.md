# Data Structures (Java)
* **allSums**: Uses recursion to find all possible sums of elements in ArrayList. Adds single numbers, then adds all others numbers to that number, then recurses to next number.
* **binarySearchTree**: This is an implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST).
* **hasCycle**: Uses Floyd's Cycle Detection algorithm: Use two pointers to move through list. One pointer is one space ahead of other. If the two pointers are at the same node then there is a cycle.
* **hashTable**: This is an implementation of a hash table.
* **matrixMult**: Uses Strassenâ€™s matrix multiplication method to multiply square matrices.
* **maxHeap**: Implements a max-Heap in Java with the operations max-heapify and Build-max-heap. Implements HeapSort to find and print out the sum of the smallest 2 numbers in the sorted array.
* **sort**: Implements Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort, and Bucket Sort. Prints the runtimes of each algorithm for input lists of sizes 100, 1000, 10000, and 100000.
* **subsetFinder**: Recursively returns n choose k by adding (decremented n elements choose k distinct elements) with (decremented elements choose decremented k distinct elements)
* **substringFinder**: Uses recursion to find substrings of s. Appends characters to each substring to get substrings that are non-contiguous.
