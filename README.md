# Data Structures (Java)
* allSums: Uses recursion to find all possible sums of elements in ArrayList. Adds single numbers, then adds all others numbers to that number, then recurses to next number.
* hasCycle: Uses Floyd's Cycle Detection algorithm: Use two pointers to move through list. One pointer is one space ahead of other. If the two pointers are at the same node then there is a cycle.
* matrixMult: Uses Strassenâ€™s matrix multiplication method to multiply square matrices.
* maxHeap: Implements a max-Heap in Java with the operations max-heapify and Build-max-heap. Implements HeapSort to find and print out the sum of the smallest 2 numbers in the sorted array.
* subsetFinder: Recursively returns n choose k by adding (decremented n elements choose k distinct elements) with (decremented elements choose decremented k distinct elements)
* substringFinder: Uses recursion to find substrings of s. Appends characters to each substring to get substrings that are non-contiguous.
